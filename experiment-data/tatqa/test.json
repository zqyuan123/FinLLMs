The Company evaluates goodwill at the reporting unit level using the discounted cash flow valuation model and allocates goodwill to these reporting units using a relative fair value approach .

Discount rates , growth rates , and cash flow projections are the most sensitive and susceptible to change , as they require significant management judgment . Discount rates are determined by using a weighted average cost of capital ( \u201cWACC\u201d ) . The WACC considers market and industry data as well as company specific risk factors . Operational management , considering industry and company specific historical and projected data , develops growth rates and cash flow projections for each  flow estimates beyond the last projected period , assuming a constant WACC and low , long term growth rates . If the recoverability test indicates potential impairment , the Company calculates an implied fair value of goodwill for the reporting unit . The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in a manner similar to how goodwill is calculated in a business combination . If the implied fair value of goodwill exceeds the carrying value of goodwill assigned to the reporting unit , there is no impairment . If the carrying value of goodwill assigned to the reporting unit exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill , an impairment charge is recorded to write down the carrying value . The calculated fair value substantially exceeded the current carrying value for all reporting units for all periods.", "Changes in the carrying amount of goodwill attributable to each reporting unit during the year ended December 31 , 2019 , were as follows ( in thousands ):", "( 1 ) Goodwill from acquisitions relates to the goodwill recorded for the acquisition of E Commerce Group Products , Inc .
