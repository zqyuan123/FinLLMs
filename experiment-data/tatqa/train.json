Goodwill is not amortized but is subject to an impairment test at a reporting unit level on an annual basis and when circumstances indicate that an impairment is more likely than not . Such circumstances that might indicate an impairment is more likely than not include a significant adverse change in the business climate for one of our reporting units or a decision to dispose of a reporting unit or a significant portion of a reporting unit . The test for goodwill impairment is a two step process . The first step of the test is performed by comparing the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying amount , including recorded goodwill . If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value , the second step is performed to measure the amount of the impairment , if any , by comparing the implied fair value of goodwill to its carrying amount . Any resulting impairment would be recorded in the current period.", "Determining the fair value of a reporting unit for purposes of the goodwill impairment test or for changes in our operating structure is judgmental in nature and involves the use of estimates and assumptions . These estimates and assumptions could have a significant impact on whether or not an impairment charge is recognized and also the magnitude of any such charge . Estimates of fair value are primarily determined using discounted cash flows and market multiples from publicly traded comparable companies . These approaches use significant estimates and assumptions including projected future cash flows , discount rate reflecting the inherent risk in future cash flows , perpetual growth rate and determination of appropriate market comparables.", "We evaluate our reporting units when changes in our operating structure occur , and if necessary , reassign goodwill using a relative fair value allocation approach . As described in Note 18 to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10 K , beginning on October 1 , 2017 , we concluded that CMS became a separate operating segment . In conjunction with the changes to reporting units , we reassigned goodwill between CGD and CMS based on their relative fair values as of October 1 , 2017 . We estimated the fair value of CGD and CMS at October 1 , 2017 based upon market multiples from publicly traded comparable companies in addition to discounted cash flows models for CMS and for a combination of CGD and CMS based on discrete financial forecasts developed by management for planning purposes . Cash flows beyond the discrete forecasts were estimated based on projected growth rates and financial ratios , influenced by an analysis of historical ratios and by calculating a terminal value at the end of the discrete financial forecasts . For the October 1 , 2017 valuations , future cash flows were discounted to present value using a discount rate of 13 % for our CMS reporting unit and 11 % for the combination of our CGD and CMS reporting units.", "For the first step of our fiscal 2019 annual impairment test , we estimated the fair value of CTS based upon market multiples from publicly traded comparable companies and for CGD and CMS , we estimated the fair value based upon a combination of market multiples from publicly traded comparable companies and discounted cash flow models . The discounted cash flows were based on discrete three year financial forecasts developed by management for planning purposes . Cash flows beyond the discrete forecasts were estimated based on projected growth rates and financial ratios , influenced by an analysis of historical ratios and by calculating a terminal value at the end of the three year forecasts . The future cash flows were discounted to present value using a discount rate of 15 % for CGD and 12.5 % for CMS . The results of our 2019 annual impairment test indicated that the estimated fair value for our CTS and CGD reporting units exceeded their carrying amounts by over 100 % , while the estimated fair value of our CMS reporting unit exceeded its carrying amount by over 60 %.", "Unforeseen negative changes in future business or other market conditions for any of our reporting units including margin compression or loss of business , could cause recorded goodwill to be impaired in the future .
