The operating profit increased from $800000 in 2016 to $1000000 in 2018, indicating the company's improved operational efficiency and effectiveness.\n\nAdditionally, the non-operating income exhibited a steady growth pattern, rising from $180000 in 2016 to $220000 in 2018. This growth can be attributed to various non-operational sources such as investments or gains from the disposal of assets.\n\nOn the other hand, the non-operating expenses also increased over the same period, reaching $350000 in 2018. These expenses comprise costs that are not directly related to the company's core operations, such as interest payments or losses from the sale of assets.\n\nMoreover, the income tax paid by XYZ Company showed a consistent upward trend in both current and deferred taxes. The current income tax increased from $50000 in 2016 to $60000 in 2018. Simultaneously, the deferred income tax climbed from $40000 in 2016 to $50000 in 2018. These tax payments highlight the company's compliance with tax regulations and its financial responsibility.\n\nIn conclusion, XYZ Company's financial statement reflects a positive growth trajectory in operating profit and non-operating income.

        "text": "Company XYZ's financial statement for the fiscal years 2013 to 2016 reveals a consistent growth trend. The operating profit saw a steady increase from $150000 in 2013 to $200000 in 2014, further reaching $180000 in 2015, and finally reaching $220000 in 2016. This growth can be attributed to the company's effective management and successful operational strategies.\n\nNon-operating income also played a significant role in Company XYZ's financial performance. Non-operating income increased from $80000 in 2013 to $95000 in 2014, and further climbed to $70000 in 2015, ultimately reaching $105000 in 2016. This increase can be attributed to the company's successful investments and other non-core business activities.\n\nHowever, the company also faced non-operating expenses that impacted its financial performance. Non-operating expenses amounted to $50000 in 2013, $75000 in 2014, $60000 in 2015, and $90000 in 2016. These expenses could be a result of various factors, such as one-time charges or losses incurred from non-core business activities.\n\nCurrent income tax was also a significant component of Company XYZ's financial statement. The company incurred $25000 as income tax in 2013, which increased to $30000 in 2014. The tax expense further rose to $40000 in 2015, and then decreased slightly to $35000 in 2016. The changing income tax expenses are likely due to fluctuations in the company's taxable income and changes in tax rates.\n\nLastly, deffered income tax also affected the company's financials. The deferred income tax expense increased from $30000 in 2013 to $40000 in 2014, and further reached $35000 in 2015. Finally, it increased to $50000 in 2016. These expenses reflect the company's tax liabilities associated with temporary differences between the book and tax values of certain assets and liabilities.\n\nOverall, Company XYZ's financial statement showcases a positive growth trend in operating profit and non-operating income. However, the company also incurred non-operating expenses and had to manage income tax expenses and deferred income taxes. These numbers provide insights into the company's financial health and performance over the given years.",
